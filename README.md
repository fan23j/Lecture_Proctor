#Lecture Proctor
Lecture proctor is a idea demonstration created for MLH devHacks. This hack received contributions from John Korolis, Jack Fan, and Mihir Patwardhan.

#Inspiration and Product
Given the state of the pandemic and it's effect on individual conduct, we wanted to introduce a concept that may provide some quality of life improvements for the student population. With the mass transition to online courses, the precendence of mass open online courses(MOOC) serves to highlight the potential drawbacks of online learning, if not apparent already. Even through conventions of common sense, there exists undeniable correlation between attentativeness and learning efficiency. In particular, the downfall of MOOC is the lack of accountability, resulting in lower attention retentions, a constrasting reality when compared to that of a traditional classroom setting. Our product proposes the use of eye-tracking and face detection to determine the presence or absence of user attention during online learning. The demo framework was built with Reactjs and the face detection was achieved through the WebGazer.js library.

#Installation
Install Node.js from the web
```bash
git clone [link]
npm install
npm i -g react-scripts
npm install axios
npm install react-player --save
npm install react-select
```
#How It Works

#End Goal
Ideally, the end state of this product will operate in a framework like Canvas. Teachers have their personalized accounts with lecture content and assignments. Students will be able to access this content and be psuedo-supervised to hopefully optimize learning efficiency. Further from just lecture proctoring, this concept extends to exam proctoring and even live-stream tracking.
